All the functions work fine for client and server. But I didn't work on to make 
sure the argument for server to pass the word to be only character. 

I opened multiple terminals to run the client and see can it support multiple 
clients at the same time. Also I tried to test on different computer, so server 
on one and client on the other one.

I think the most challenging part is the 4 bytes headers for send and recv, as 
it make the code become more complicated. Also fork is a little bit difficult 
for me, cause I am not so familiar about using fork.
