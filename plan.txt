This assignment will only have one python file, server and client will be
included in the same file. User uses the argument to determine which mode they
are using. For the command line, server need to type in the mode, port number,
word and ip. Client will need to provide mode, ip and port number.
Server will initialize the board after it received the word and initialize the
number of guesses remaining to from N( N=3) to K (which is the number of
characters of the word). When N is bigger than 0, which means still have chances
to guess, server will send the number N and K to the client, client displays
the board and number of guesses remaining. Client will ask user to provide the
guess and then send the guessed letter as a char to the server. If the letter
is included in the secret word, the letter will replace the corresponding
underscores, if no N is decremented. Player wins the game if N>0 and get all
the letters. Then client will print the board one last time and print You won.
Client will then close the socket and exit. If player loses the game. Client
will do the same as player won but this time instead of print you won, the
client will print you lose. The server need to handle multiple clients
separately so fork is needed.

I have never used python before so it is going be a big challenges for me,
and I think the hardest part will be using fork and making the server to handle
different client at the same time but separately.
